   Programming Assignment 4: Fun With Stacks

2)  main.cpp
    ListNode.h
    GenStack.h
    SyntaxChecker.h
    SyntaxChecker.cpp
    FileProcessor.h
    FileProcessor.cpp
    Makefile

3) Program will not execute correctly if there is a delimiter left on the stack at the end of the file. I also get two warnings when compiling: "./GenStack.h:118:1: warning: non-void function does not return a value in all control paths". Although these do not appear when I compiled on a different computer. Getting a correct output seems to be iffy, met with my tutor twice and she only seemed to mess up my code more, which makes me want to pull my hair out.

4) Kayla Anderson helped me figure out my segmentation fault, worked with a tutor to try and figure out why my code isn't working fully for hours and she could not help me. Sad.
